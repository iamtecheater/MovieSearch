ASP.net Core web application using OMDB API
# My first attempt in creating a web application using Asp.net Core and OMDB API.
# I added extra features to the web app like List and Login to give it more appeal.
# I did not use certain Nuget packages as I am unfamilar with them and would need to research them more.
# I am very happy with the outcome of the application that I have built considering
it was my first attempt after learning how to build ASP.net Core applications using Microsoft Documentation.
