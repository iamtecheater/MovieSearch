ASP.net Core web application using OMDB API
- My first attempt in creating a web application using Asp.net Core and OMDB API.
- I added extra features to the web app like List and Login to give it more appeal.
- I did not use certain Nuget packages as I am unfamilar with them and would need to research them more.
- I am very happy with the outcome of the application that I have built considering that it was my first attempt after learning how to build ASP.net Core applications using Microsoft Documentation.
- In the solution MovieSearch navigate to Services.OMDBServices and change private string apiKey = "&apikey=[your api key]";
